Cook the orzo according to package instructions, or use your Instant Pot to make Instant Pot Orzo. 
Let the orzo cool to room temperature while prepping the rest of the ingredients. 
 In a large bowl, combine the orzo with the entire cans of tuna (tuna + oil), mayonnaise, celery, green onion, dill, lemon zest and lemon juice. Mix well. 
Add a few grinds of black pepper and a generous amount of salt to taste.
Taste and adjust the flavor to your liking, adding more mayo and/or lemon juice if needed.
If this salad has been refrigerated for a day, you'll probably have to adjust the flavors again before serving, most likely adding more lemon and salt.

|Pork Noodles|
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
14 oz flat rice noodle(410 g), such as for pad thai
boiling water, for soaking noddles
2 tablespoons toasted sesame oil, plus more for serving
1 ½ lb ground pork(650 g)
6 scallions, white and light green parts minced, dark green parts thinly sliced
kosher salt, to taste
freshly ground black pepper, to taste
2 tablespoons chile-garlic paste, plus more for serving
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Place the noodles in a large bowl and add boiling water to cover. Use tongs to separate the noodles to prevent clumping, then let sit for 5 minutes to soften. Reserve ¼ cup of the noodle soaking water and drain the noodles.
Meanwhile, heat the sesame oil in a wok or large skillet over high heat. Add the pork and minced scallions, season with salt and pepper, and cook, stirring to break up the pork with a wooden spoon, until browned, 6–8 minutes.
Add the noodles, reserved soaking water, and the chile-garlic paste to the wok and stir until the noodles are evenly coated in the sauce.
Transfer the noodles and sauce to serving bowls and top with the sliced scallion greens. Serve with more sesame oil and chile-garlic paste alongside.
